1 Introduction 

  The NSA, the National Security Agency, has contacted you
  to do a Proof of Concept for a decoder tester. The NSA has
  discovered that people more and more use simple encoding
  technics to encode their messages. And they want to read
  these messages...

  So they've ordered an application that enables them to
  simply add new decoders, preferably to a properties file.
  Since this is just a Proof of Concept it's not yet necessary
  to read the decoders from a file. They've decided to test
  the concept with three encoders that you have to hard code
  into the test application.

  The encoders are quite strait forward. Take a text and
  change it in a subtle way to create hidden messages. Or
  create a custom text that incorporates the message. Because
  the receiver still has to decode these messages, the
  encodings are always very simple.

  They've decided to test the following encodings:
  - All capital letters in a text.
  - The letters of a word that starts with a vowel, but not
    the vowel itself.
  - Words that are only letter.

2 Assignment

  A framework for the PoC has already been made. All you 
  have to do is code the Decoders. You have to decide how 
  to go about selecting the letters you want to keep in the 
  message. The framework will provide the results of your
  decoders on the console. 

  The decoders should do this:
  1) All capital letters:
     Select all capital letters, discarding everything else.
  2) Vowel prefixed words:
     Select words that start with a vowel, discarding the vowel
     and every word that does not start with a vowel. In this
     respect, the following characters are understood to be
     vowels: a, e, i, o, u, y, A, E, I, O, U, Y.
  3) Single letter words:
     Words that consist of a single letter, for instance I.
     
  A generic Decoder based upon regular expressions has been 
  provided allowing an efficient implementation. No more
  StringTokenizers for you ! Hah !    

3 Examples

  1) All capital letters:
     Text   : Brains Or Muscles are a Bore.
     Decoded: bomb
     
  2) Vowel prefixed words:
     Text   : Up we go. Are going down too. Is aid we need?
              Ye 'ant the lead.
     Decoded: president
     
  3) Single letter words:
     Text   : B is for blue, she is for U. S is a sage,
              in search of an H.
     Decoded: bush 

4 Tips

  1) You must decide: select what to keep, or select what to throw away.
  2) The pattern is clear, but how about the expression?
  3) Afraid of Regular Expressions ? Try to implement and add your own 
     Decoder. Ofcourse your fingers will hurt after this assignment :-)
  4) The java.util.regex.Pattern Javadoc actually contains a nice summary 
     of writing regular expressions. Also for your benefit the following 
     constants have been provided : 

     CAPITAL            = "[A-Z]";
     NOT_CAPITAL        = "[^A-Z]";
     SPACE              = " ";
     VOWELS             = "[aAeEiIuUoOyY]";
     NOT_VOWELS         = "[^aAeEiIuUoOyY]";
     PUNCTUATION        = "[ .!?;.,'\"()\\-]";
     NORMAL_LETTERS     = "[a-zA-Z0-9']";
     NOT_NORMAL_LETTERS = "[^a-zA-Z0-9']";
     OR                 = "|";
     CHOICE_START       = "[";
     CHOICE_END         = "]";
     MULTIPLICITY       = "*";
     TWO_OR_MORE        = "{2,}";
