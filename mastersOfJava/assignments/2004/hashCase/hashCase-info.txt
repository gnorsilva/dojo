1 Introduction

  With the legalisation of so called soft-drugs in 2005 in the Netherlands the hashies 
  business is booming. More and more kinds of specially grown weeds (with maximised 
  levels of THC - the active compound of hashies) appear on the market.
  
  Life for the casual coffee shop owner has become complicated. In the old days when
  hashies were merely tolerated there was not such an overwhelming offering.

  The old inventory managment software of your local coffee shop (an InAccurate TM 
  product) cannot deal with the onflood of new brands. Also it is proprietary software
  and comes in a sealed and signed Jar file. The inventory system itself cannot be modified,
  although you managed to reverse compile the source code. Also a strict licencing scheme
  also limits the creation of new Inventory classes. 
  
  Oh, also InAccurate B.V. has gone bust, so no new Inventory classes can be bought.
  
  The only option now is to modify the existing Leaf class to trick the inventory 
  system into thinking that one Leaf object is not neccecarily equal to another.
  
2 Assignment

  Adjust the Leaf class in such a way that the Inventory class organises its inventory
  according to the brand of Leaf instead to the Leaf itself.
  
3 Example

  If the following Leaves are put in to the inventory :
  Leaf("Purple Power"),Leaf("Purple Power"),Leaf("Afghan"),Lead("Shiva")
  The output should become :
  Leaf(Purple Power) : 2
  Leaf(Afghan) : 1
  Leaf(Shiva) : 1
  (Not neccecarily in that order)

4 Hints

  - Some objects are more equal that others.
  - How does hash work ?
  - Do you read your java doc ?
