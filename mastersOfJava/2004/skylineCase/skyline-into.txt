1 Introduction

  The city of Rotterdam is quite obsessed by its skyline. Modern buildings that
  reach into the clouds (on misty days :-) The euromast is clearly not high enough.

  A special program needs to be written to enable the city council to visualise 
  the future skyline of Rotterdam. The program must take new and existing buildings
  as its input and produce the skyline of Rotterdam as a series of points.
 
  
2 Assignment

  Write a program that implements the SkyLineRenderer interface and correctly
  calculates the skyline using the offered buildings.
  
  In this system a building is defined as a two dimensional rectangle with a
  height, width and a position on the horizon :
  
  4                     4
  3    /----\           3    X----X
  2    |    |      -->  2    |    |
  1    |    |           1    |    |
  0---------------      0    X    X 
   012345678901234       012345678901234
             1                     1
  
  The above building has a height of 3 and a width of 6. The position on the
  horizon is 4. When a skyline needs to be calculated and this building is
  the only input the following sequence must be produced : (4,0),(4,3),(9,3),(9,0)
  
  A skyline follows the outline of the buildings, moves from left to right
  over the horizon and starts and ends on the horizon (i.e. y=0)

3 Example

  As input two buildings
  - Position 6, Height 3, Width 12 
  - Position 2, Height 5, Width 7
  
  5  /-----\                    5  X-----X                          
  4  |     |                    4  |     |
  3  |   /----------\     -->   3  |     X--------X    
  2  |   |          |           2  |              |
  1  |   |          |           1  |              |          
  0---------------------        0  X              X  
   012345678901234567890         012345678901234567890        
             1         2                   1         2       
  
  The output should be : (2,0),(2,5),(8,5),(8,3),(17,3),(17,0)
  

4 Hints & Tips

  - There is a difference here between going up and going down !
  - The right most point of a building is calculated as : position + width - 1
  - In this case, only the highest point wins !
