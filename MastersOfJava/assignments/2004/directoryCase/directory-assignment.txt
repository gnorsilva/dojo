DIRECTORY CASE

1 Introduction

Will Bates of MySoft Inc has created an Operating System including a novel
file system. Yet Will has been convinced by the new hypes and trends that
his file system is hopelessly outdated. It uses a flat file structure, is
a normal tree, doesn't hype... in other words Will wants to do XML!

In order to prepare this, though, he needs you to write a program to get
out the file references of his proprietary file system. He will give you
the interface to his Directory system and hopes you can do the job!

2 Assignment

Recursively read out the Directory tree structure and set up a list of all
files including their full pathnames. You get a Directory interface as input
and this allows you to navigate the tree structure by opening and closing
directories, while you can also ask for all the incumbent files and sub-
directories.

3. Example

INPUT:

	/
	+-- foldera
	    +-- alpha
	    +-- beta
	    +-- gamma
	+-- folderb
	    +-- delta
	    +-- epsilon

OUTPUT:

	/foldera/alpha
	/foldera/beta
	/foldera/gamma
	/folderb/delta
	/folderb/epsilon

4. Tips

Recursion helps.

Good luck!
