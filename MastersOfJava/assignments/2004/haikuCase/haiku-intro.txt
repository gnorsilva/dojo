1 Introduction 

  Haiku is one of the most important forms of traditional japanese poetry. 
  
  Haiku is, today, a 17-syllable verse form consisting of three lines of 
  5, 7, and 5 syllables and the inclusion of a seasonal reference. So the
  first line has 5 syllables, the second 7 and the third 5 and one of the
  lines should contain a reference to a season.

2 Assignment

  The program that needs to be written for this assignment must be capable of
  checking haiku for correctness. The haiku's are offered to the HaikuChecker 
  interface. Whenever a Haiku is incorrect a InvalidHaikuException needs to be
  thrown containg a message descripting the fault.
  
  The program needs to perform the following checks :
  - The haiku must consist of 3 lines.
  - The first line must contain 5 syllables.
  - The second line must contain 7 syllables.
  - The third line must contain 5 syllables.
  - There must be at least one reference to a season. To ease devlopment
    the seasons are defined in the Haiku Interface.     

3 Example 

  Examine the following (correct) Haiku :

  "smetteloos bloesems" -> 1st line, 5 syllables
  "de lentezon kent haar naam" -> 2nd line, 7 syllables and a season reference.
  "de vlinder dwarrelt" -> 3rd line, 5 syllables, 

4 Tips 

  Counting syllables is not that hard. Its a matter of counting groups of vowels in
  a word. For example 'pIndAkAAs' has three syllables and 'bIEr' has only one.

  Succes !
