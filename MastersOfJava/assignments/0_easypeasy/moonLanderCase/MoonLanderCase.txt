1 Introduction

  The year is 2048 and WASA launches its first 'Interplanetary Explorer', a spaceship that 
  is able to visit all the planets of the solar system and safely land on them as well. That
  last bit is not that easy because the gravity on all those planets is different and so are
  the height of atmospheric entry and fuel reserves.

2 Assigment

  Implement the descision routine of the Lander what decides if the engines should be active
  or not. The input parameters are the current height, speed, fuel reserves and the gravity.
  When the routine returns true the engines will engage and slow the lander (or if left on
  too long accelerate the lander into space..) 

  The descision routine is called 10 times per second.  
  
  The objective of course is a safe landing.

3 Example
  
  The Lander is at 100 metres altitude. Its speed is 10 metres per second. The
  gravity is 5 metres per second squared. There is sufficient fuel.
  
  If the engine remains off, after 0.1 seconds the speed will be 10.5 m/s and 
  the altitude 99 metres.
  
  If the engine is turned on, after 0.1 seconds the speed will be 9.5 m/s and 
  the altitude 99 metres.
  
  What to do ? Engage the engines or let it fall ?
  
4 Hints

  - If the fuel is almost gone your best bet is to let gravity do all the work and at
    the last moment use all your fuel to land safely.
